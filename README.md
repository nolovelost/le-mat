# God Dies
No one ever came to me and said, "You're a fool. There isn't such a thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing you." It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized that he wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right. -- Frances Farmer

If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise. -- William Blake
